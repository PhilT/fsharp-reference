# Introduction

This reference is a summary of the F# Language taken from
the [Microsoft Language Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/).
A few [other sources](references.html) were used where necessary to fully
grasp the concepts.

## The format

This summary tries to cover all the language concepts without repeating content and
explanations. It's also written in a compilable format to ensure all example code
runs without errors on .NET Core 3.
