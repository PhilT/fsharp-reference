description: I've been a professional software developer for almost 20 years. I've written a lot of website applications and I absolutely love what I do. I've used ASP, Assembler, Bash, Batch, C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, SQL and dabbled with many more. My real passion, however, is writing computer games.

It's taken a while for me to realise this but never too late, as they say. So I'm making the switch to becoming a game developer, designer, director, owner and hopefully get a few people to help me in my quest.

## A bit more about me

I was 7 years old when I got my first computer. A Commodore 64. It didn't take me long to go from playing games to keying in the programs from the manual and magazines.

When I was at school, Graham, a friend in the year above gave me a book on C programming and I was hooked. Later, I programmed graphics, 3D, effects and made a few small demos with a friend of mine and some games such as a tron light cycle clone and 2 player Asteroids style shoot 'em up.

I also got into electronic music and music programs called trackers that allowed you to trigger samples at certain times to create music. It was magical!

I played around with graphics software, 3D modelling software, even CAD programs. Lego, Meccano and Scalextric also featured heavily. I loved creating things with any medium I could get my hands on. One time I built a scale model Spitfire out of balsa wood. It glided incredibly well. So well, in fact, it flew straight into a tree! I enjoyed technical drawing at school and even toyed with the idea of going to art college until I was advised against it!

I've built a Media PC using MDF and one with perspex, a tiny PC using a coffee tin and PCs built into cars. My previous setup was a custom built gaming chair.

## My vision

Although I love what I do, I've had an idea for a game for 20 years. It's changed a lot over the years, had plenty of false starts but it's always been at the back of my mind.

We are living in a time of such amazing opportunities, technology advances and ease to market. It's time to seize the moment and make it happen.

I also believe I can bring something new to the industry. There are plenty of
Angry Birds or Call of Duty games out there so we need to throw a few new ideas in there. *Super Hot* is a great example of this. Truly original. Let's do more of that.
