title: Automated Testing In F# With Expecto
description: Test or Behaviour Driven Development has been a staple in my workflow for years. Now that I've got some familiarity with F# it's time to get serious.

.NET has a bunch of testing tools such as xUnit, NUNit and MSTest. However,
this is F# so I wanted something a little more idiomatic.

## Expecto Patron...

Err, anyway. It runs tests in parallel and async which is a nice boost. It's
got a test runner built in so no need for additional libraries. I'm a (Neo)Vim
user but there are runners for VSCode and Visual Studio.

It also comes with performance testing which sounds intriguing especially
for game development. I'll take a look at that later.

There is also support for property based testing through FsCheck. I'll not
be using FsCheck to begin with, preferring to stick with what I know but
it's definitely something I want to add later on.

## Installing Expecto

There is a dotnet project template, however, I like to know what is going
into it so we'll set it up manually.

All we need to begin with is Expecto itself.

    dotnet paket add Expecto

## Running our first test

  Time for a "Hello world" example:
 *)

#r "../../packages/Expecto/lib/netstandard2.0/Expecto"

open Expecto

test "A simple test" {
  let subject = "Hello World"
  Expect.equal subject "Hello World" "Should match"
}
|> runTestsWithCLIArgs [] [||]

Nice!

I'll need to know a few more features in order to get started with testing
in my project.

## Grouping tests

`testlist` can be used to group a bunch of tests. `testList` can be nested.
*)

testList "Group of tests" [
  test "a test" {
    Expect.equal (2 + 2) 4 ""
  }

  test "another test" {
    Expect.equal (3 + 3) 6 ""
  }
]
|> runTestsWithCLIArgs [] [||]

## Pending and focused tests.

Prefix `test` with a `p` to mark it as pending and it'll be excluded in test runs.
To only run some tests it's `f` for focused test.
 *)

testList "unfocused test list" [
  test "won't run" { Expect.isTrue false "This should have run" }
  ftest "will run" { Expect.isTrue true "This is meant to run" }
]

(**
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to have Expecto auto-discover tests
and shuffle them. `Test.shuffle` only works on a list of tests. Perhaps this
could be added as an option.

 *)

(**
One thing I don't like is the extra message string. Often, it's obvious what's
going on without needing clarification. Especially with BDD where test cases
generally have a single expectation and the text of that is usually enough.

However, there is a workaround. As suggested by the creator:
*)

module Expect =
  let equal a b = b |> Expect.equal "" a

(**
This would mean a proliferation of new functions mirroring the old so for now
I'll stick with the standard syntax unless my OCD gets the better of me.

For testing my project I'll need to run all the tests in the project. This
can be done by marking tests with the `Tests` attribute:
*)

[<Tests>]
testList "test list" [
  test "a test" { Expect.isTrue true "" }
]

(**
And then running with one of the `*InAssembly` functions:
 *)

[<EntryPoint>]
let main args =
  runTestsInAssemblyWithCLIArgs [] args

(**
This brings up another issue. A handy feature in Expecto is `Test.shuffle`.
However, it requires you pass it a list of tests. This rules it out from
being used with the above `runTestsInAssembly*` functions. This limits it's
usefulness. However, as we're starting out I'm okay with this. It's a great
potential PR for the project.

Integrations with BenchmarkDotNet, FsCheck and Hopac can be added to
`paket.dependencies` (ac - Add-Content):

```powershell
ac paket.dependencies nuget Expecto.BenchmarkDotNet
ac paket.dependencies nuget Expecto.FsCheck
ac paket.dependencies nuget Expecto.Hopac

dotnet paket install
```

## Integrating with .NET

We can make Expecto play nicely with the `dotnet` CLI by adding a couple of
packages. This also removes the need for a `Program.cs` entrypoint file as it's
generated automatically.

```powershell
ac paket.dependencies nuget Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
ac paket.dependencies nuget YoloDev.Expecto.TestSdk

dotnet paket install
```

Then you can run tests with the `dotnet` command:

```powershell
dotnet test
```

However, I don't like the output this generates so I'm sticking with the manual
`Program.cs` file so I can run the project with `dotnet run`. `dotnet test` would
still be useful for CI, though.
