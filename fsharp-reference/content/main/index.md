Referenced from [Microsoft Language Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/).

A few [other sources](references.html) were used where additional clarity
was required.

It's meant to serve as a broad overview of the language and although every effort
has been made to cover all language features, details have been kept light (e.g.
type definitions have been omitted). Please see the original reference for full
descriptions.

## The format

This summary tries to cover all the language concepts without repeating content and
explanations. It's also written in a compilable format to ensure all example code
runs without errors. It also attempts to put more emphasis on functional concepts.
It is somewhat opinionated, attempting to give a single, idiomatic way rather
than too many options.

## Roadmap

More updates are coming and guides will be added to cover topics such as functional
programming and testing as well as a searchable core library reference.

Comments are also planned.

## F# Version

All examples run on version 4.7 but will be updated as new versions are
released.

## Issues, Help, Comms, Development

This site is a work in progress. Comments, suggestions or corrections are most
welcome.
