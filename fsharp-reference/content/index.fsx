description: A quick reference of F#.
---

This reference is a summary of the F# Language taken from
the [Microsoft Language Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/).
A few [other sources](references.html) were used where additional clarity
was required.

It's meant to serve as a quick reference. Please see the original reference for full descriptions.


## The format

This summary tries to cover all the language concepts without repeating content and
explanations. It's also written in a compilable format to ensure all example code
runs without errors. It also attempts to put more emphasis on functional concepts.
